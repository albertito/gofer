// Test file used to build a coverage-enabled binary.
//
// Go lacks support for properly building a coverage binary, it can only build
// coverage test binaries.  As a workaround, we have a test that just runs
// main. We then build a binary of this test, which we use instead of the
// normal binary in integration tests.
//
// This is hacky and horrible.
//
// The test has a build label so it's not accidentally executed during normal
// "go test" invocations.
